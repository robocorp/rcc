## License change notice

### Executive summary

This is a license change notice for the RCC component of the Sema4.ai product.

This change only impacts users who rely on RCC as a standalone component.

Customers having a commercial relationship with Sema4.ai, Inc. or Robocorp Technologies, Inc. are unaffected by the change.

### Background

Robocorp Technologies, Inc. was acquired by Sema4.ai, Inc. in January 2024. Parts of the Robocorp (Sema4.ai) product, such as RCC, have been available and usable as standalone components.

Up to and including version 18.5.0, published on 25 Oct 2024, RCC has been available in two forms:

1. Pre-built binary distribution licensed under [Robocorp End User License Agreement](https://cdn.robocorp.com/legal/Robocorp-EULA-v1.0.pdf)
1. Source code distribution licensed under the Apache 2.0 License

### License change

Effective immediately:

1. Pre-built binary distribution of RCC is licensed under [Sema4.ai End User License Agreement](https://sema4.ai/cdn/downloads/legal/Sema4ai-EULA-v1.0.pdf)
1. Source code is not made publicly available
1. Sema4.ai does not provide support for use of RCC as a standalone component 

### What this means in practice

Customers who rely on RCC as part of the Sema4.ai AI Agent or Automation platform are unaffected. RCC continues to be an integral part of the stack, and its use is covered by the existing commercial agreements.
Users who rely on the RCC prebuilt binaries provided by Sema4.ai may continue using them under the current Sema4.ai End User License Agreement.
Users who rely on the Apache 2.0 source code distribution may keep using and building on the previously published versions.
