# Introduction

RCC allows you to create, manage, and distribute Python-based self-contained automation packages. RCC also allows you to run your automations in isolated Python environments so they can still access the rest of your machine.

ðŸš€ "Repeatable, movable and isolated Python environments for your automation."

Together with [robot.yaml](https://sema4.ai/docs/automation/robot-structure/robot-yaml-format) configuration file, `rcc` is a foundation that allows anyone to build and share automation easily.

RCC is actively maintained by [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai/).


## Why use rcc?

* You do not need to install Python on the target machine
* You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on (..and which pip version is used to resolve dependencies)
* You can avoid `Works on my machine`
* No need for `venv`, `pyenv`, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
* Define dependencies in `conda.yaml` and automation config in `robot.yaml` and let RCC do the heavy lifting.
* If you have run into "dependency drifts", where once working runtime environment dependencies get updated and break your production system?, RCC can freeze ALL dependencies, pre-build environments, and more.
* RCC will give you a heads-up if your automations have been leaving behind processes after running.

...and much much more.

ðŸ‘‰ If the command line seems scary, just pick up [Seam4.ai -extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sema4ai.sema4ai) -extension for VS Code, and you'll get the power of RCC directly in VS Code without worrying about the commands.
