       1.2. Open-Source Software. Certain software code incorporated into or distributed with the Software may be licensed by third parties under various "open-source" or "public-source" software licenses (such as the Apache License) (collectively, the "Open Source Software"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, the Open Source Software is not licensed under Section 1.1 and instead is separately licensed pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective open-source software licenses. You agree to comply with the terms and conditions of such open-source software license agreements.

Any future release, update or other addition to the Software shall be subject to this EULA. Sema4, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in this EULA. Any unauthorized use of the Software shall permit Sema4 to terminate the licenses granted pursuant to this EULA.
       2.2. Generative AI.
              2.2.1. Generated Output.  Certain features of the Software permit you to provide prompts, scripts, queries or other input (collectively, "Input") to the Software in order to receive output generated and returned by the Software based on such Input ("Output").  You agree not to state or suggest that Output was human-generated when it is not.  The Software is not intended to be used, and you agree not to use the Software to generate any Output, for: any illegal activity; child sexual abuse material or any content that exploits or harms children; generation of hateful, harassing, or violent content; generation of viruses or malware; any activity that has high risk of physical harm; any activity that has high risk of economic harm; fraudulent or deceptive activity; adult content, adult industries or dating apps; political campaigning or lobbying; activity that violates people’s privacy; unauthorized practice of law or offering tailored legal advice without a qualified person’s review; offering tailored financial advice; diagnosing a certain health condition, or providing treatment instructions; providing diagnostic or treatment services for serious medical conditions; triaging or managing life-threatening issues that need immediate attention; or high risk decision-making. In addition, you will comply with any third party terms, guidelines, policies or the like to which we link in connection with your generation of Output. 
              2.2.2. Ownership of Input and Output.   As between you and Sema4, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own all Input and, subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA and solely to the extent Sema4 obtains any ownership in any copyrights in your Output, Sema4 hereby assigns to you our ownership interest in such copyrights to your Output.  You are responsible for all Input and Output, including for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or this EULA.
              2.2.3. Similarity of Output.  Due to the automated content generation, Output may not be unique across users and the Software may generate the same or similar output for you, Sema4 or a third party. Other users may also provide similar Input and receive the same or similar Output. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not considered your Output.  You hereby irrevocably release, acquit and forever discharge, and agree not to sue, Sema4 and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (collectively, "Sema4 Parties") with respect to any liability for direct or indirect copyright, trademark or other infringement, misappropriation or violation of any rights with respect to the Output.
              2.2.4. Accuracy.  Use of the Software may in some situations result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places or facts.  You agree to evaluate and be responsible for the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for your use case.
              2.2.5. Limitations of AI-Generated Output. You acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the limitations and restrictions set forth in this EULA, there are numerous limitations that apply with respect to artificial intelligence (AI)-generated Output due to the fact that it is automatically generated, including that (a) it may contain errors or misleading information, (b) AI systems are based on predefined rules and algorithms that lack the ability to think creatively and come up with new ideas and can result in repetitive or formulaic content, (c) AI systems can struggle with understanding the nuances of language, including slang, idioms, and cultural references, which can result in Output that is out of context or does not make sense, (d) AI systems do not have emotions and cannot understand or convey emotions in the way humans can, which can result in Output that lacks the empathy and emotion that humans are able to convey, (e) AI systems can perpetuate biases that are present in the data used to train them, which can result in Output that is discriminatory or offensive, (f) AI systems can struggle with complex tasks that require reasoning, judgment and decision-making, (g) AI systems require large amounts of data to train and generate content, and the data used to train AI systems may be of poor quality or biased, which will negatively impact the accuracy and quality of the generated Output, and (h) AI-generated Output can lack the personal touch that comes with content created by humans, which can make it seem cold and impersonal.
              2.2.6. Disclaimers Regarding the use of Generative AI; Not Professional Advice.  Under no circumstances will Sema4 be liable in any way for any Output, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Output.  You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Output.  Sema4 is not in the business of providing legal or other professional services or advice. Consult the services of a competent professional when you need this type of assistance.

Sema4 has no control over such sites and resources and Sema4 is not responsible for and does not endorse such sites and resources.  You further acknowledge and agree that Sema4 will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, events, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource.

7. Term and Termination.
       7.1. Term. This EULA will commence on the date when you accept it (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with this Section 7.
       7.2. Termination by Sema4. If you have breached any provision of this EULA or Sema4 suspects that you have breached any provision of this EULA, or if Sema4 is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Software, or your use of the Software, is, or becomes, unlawful), Sema4 has the right to suspend or terminate any services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Sema4's sole discretion and that Sema4 shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account. In addition, the provision of certain functionality provided by Sema4 through the Software will automatically terminate if you no longer use or have access to the equipment.

8. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver. 
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
       8.1. Agreement to Arbitrate.  You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Sema4, whether arising out of or relating to this EULA (including any alleged breach thereof), the Software, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Section. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Section, the applicable terms of this Section will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent terms of this Section would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Sema4 or you under the AAA Rules, Sema4 and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Sema4 will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sema4 will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this EULA as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this EULA and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
       8.2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND SEMA4 AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SEMA4 AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

9. General Provisions.

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from Sema4 in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Sema4 provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.
       9.3. Assignment. This EULA, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Sema4's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

       9.7. Notice. Where Sema4 requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Sema4 with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Sema4 is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by this EULA, Sema4's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Sema4 at support@Sema4.com.
       9.8. Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this EULA on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
       9.9. Severability. If any provision of this EULA is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this EULA will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
       9.10. Export Control. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Software except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Software, and any other applicable laws.
